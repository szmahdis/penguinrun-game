_Implementation Details:_

The player is chased by enemies in maze-like city and has to collect the collectibles to complete the level. The focus of this game is on level design. Map is divided into districts (Miyamoto’s Miniature Garden). Starting point acts as vantage point so the player can view the whole map and move in desired section. Multiple paths between sectors promote the  player's choice. Collectibles are placed as wayfinding cues and decoration serve as “borders” for the map. Verticality is another level design that was implemented in this game.
